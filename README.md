Clients Form | My first project with Google script

1. The point of this Web App is adding clients to google sheets.
   So you have inputs with names, date and time, when you wrote it and sent newData by button,
   all information send to google sheets.

   - My future plans for this projects:
     1. Make a window, where you enter name of client, you will get every data about it.
